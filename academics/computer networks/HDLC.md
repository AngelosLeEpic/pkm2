- A method to designate different frames in the data link layer before sending them out or while reading them
- Hight-Level Data Link Control protocol
- each [[frame]] begins and ends with a special bit pattern, 01111110 = 0x7E
- this is known as the flag byte
- As the [[data link]] layer processes the data, when it encounters 5 1s in a row, it stuffs a 0 into the outgoing bit stream
- for example $01011111100010$ -> $010111110100010$
- this bit stuffing is analogous to byte stuffing
- it ensures a minimum density of transitions, meaning we flip from 1 to 0 many times so that the protocols in the physical layer can remain in sync, this is why this method is often used in [[USB]]
- the receiver automatically removes the additional 0 every time they read 5 consecutive 1
